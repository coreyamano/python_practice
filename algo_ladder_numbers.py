# 1. FizzBuzz
# Description
# Write a function that prints out every number from 1 to N, with the following exceptions:
# If the number is divisible by 3, print out "FIZZ".
# If the number is divisible by 5, print out "BUZZ".
# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print out "FIZZBUZZ".

# 3. Fibonacci numbers
# Description
# Write a function that gives the Nth number of the Fibonacci Sequence. The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1, and every number thereafter is the sum of the previous two numbers. So the sequence goes like this:
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on until infinity...
# Input: 9
# Output: 21 (as this is the 9th number of the Fibonacci Sequence)

# 4. Leap Year

# Description
# Given a year, report if it is a leap year.
# The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
# unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
# For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is . 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is .
# If your language provides a method in the standard library that does this look-up, 
# pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

# 5. Multiples of 3 and 5

# 6. Collatz Conjecture
# Description
# The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:
# Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.
# Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.
# Examples
# Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:
# 12
# 6
# 3
# 10
# 5
# 16
# 8
# 4
# 2
# 1
# Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.

            number = (number * 3) + 1
            steps += 1

# 7. Largest Palindrome Product
